# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection

#Driver drowsiness detection is a project built using Dlib and OpenCV with Python as a backend language.

#The project includes direct working with the 68 facial landmark detector and also the face detector of the Dlib library.

#The 68 facial landmark detector is a robustly trained efficient detector which detects the points on the human face using which 
we determine whether the eyes are open or they are closed.
